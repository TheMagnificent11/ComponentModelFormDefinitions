## Overview

This NPM packages is designed to be used in conjunction with an ASP.Net Web API site.  The API site has a route that retrieves form defintions.  These definitions are generated using the `ComponentModelFormDefintions` NuGet package.

`ngrx-componentmodelformdefintions` is an NGRX implemenation that retrieves those form defintions.

There is also `ngrx-componentmodelformdefintions-material`, which displays that form definition as a simple Angular Material form.  It uses the `@ng-dynamic-forms/core` and `@ng-dynamic-forms/ui-material` NPM packages under the covers.
